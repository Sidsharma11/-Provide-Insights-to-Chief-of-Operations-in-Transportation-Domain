### Business Request - 2: Monthly City-Level Trips Target Performance Report
Generate a report that evaluates the target performance for trips at the monthly and city
level. For each city and month, compare the actual total trips with the target trips and
categorise the performance as follows:

If actual trips are greater than target trips, mark it as "Above Target".

If actual trips are less than or equal to target trips, mark it as "Below Target".

Additionally, calculate the % difference between actual and target trips to quantify the
performance gap.

Fields:

City_name

month_name

actual_trips

target_trips

%_difference
